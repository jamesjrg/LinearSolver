plan:

math reading:
- read Larson chap 9
- read cormen chapter 29, p843, do exercises, write algos

UI reading:
- read chap 13 of WPF4 unleased section on binding
- read Advanced MVVM ebook

todo now:
- when model coefficient matrix is rebuilt parentheses need to be rescaled and equals sign repositioned

// todo some time:

/ on linear equations tab:
- unit test linear equation solver

/ on linear programming tab:
- write algo
- bind algo to ui

///

not going to bother with:
/ on linear equations tab:
- allow m*n matrices
- better handling yet of tabbing between elements - seems listbox items are included in tabbing as well as the contained controls, and setting tabstop=false doesn't help
- changing number of unknowns has a little lag

study the mathematical theory in more detail:
- read Strang (introduction to LA, or LA and its applications 1.3, 1.5) on gaussian elim, LU and LUP decomp) and do some exercises
- read Strang (introduction to LA 3.1 and 3.2, or LA and its applications 2.1, 2.2) on vector spaces, m*n systems of equations
- do exercises in cormen matrix algos chapter (chap 28 I think)

/ on linear programming tab:
- maybe you can add more constraints by clicking a "+" icon with "add constraint" written on it, like in Quest UI for adding conditions etc?
- negative coefficients
- mixed constraints
- integer constraint

study the mathematical theory in more detail
- read Strang 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 (linear inequalities, simplex, duality) and do some exercises
- do exercises in Cormen chap 29
- do Larson chap 9 exercises

/ both tabs:
- don't allow nullifying of updowns (e.g. by rewriting control, or by adding some sort of bolted on validation logic)
