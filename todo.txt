plan:
- math reading and exercises - est 3 days FT
- UI reading - est 1 day FT
- write linear program algo and link to UI - est 1 days FT
- unit tests - est 2 days FT
- tidying est 1 day FT

math reading:
- read Strang 1.3, 1.5 (gaussian elim, LU and LUP decomp) and do some exercises
- read Strang 2,1 2.2 (vector spaces, m*n systems of equations) and then write m*n matrix algos
- read Strang 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 (linear inequalities, simplex, duality) and do some exercises
- read first 2/3 of cormen matrix operations chapter, do exercises, write algos
- read cormen chapter 29, p843, do exercises, write algos

UI reading:
- read chap 13 of WPF4 unleased section on binding
- read Advanced MVVM ebook

todo now:
- when model coefficient matrix is rebuilt parentheses need to be rescaled and equals sign repositioned

// todo some time:

/ on linear equations tab:
- sort out tab order 
- changing number of unknowns has big lag
- unit test linear equation solver
- understand lup decomp and solving a bit better
- allow m*n matrices

/ on linear programming tab:
- write algo
- bind algo to ui

///

not going to bother with:
- maybe you can add more constraints by clicking a "+" icon with "add constraint" written on it, like in Quest UI for adding conditions etc?
- don't allow nullifying of updowns (e.g. by rewriting control, or by adding some sort of bolted on validation logic)
